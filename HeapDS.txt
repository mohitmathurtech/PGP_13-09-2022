Heap Data Structure 
A heap is a special tree based structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree.

Operations possible in a Heap Data Structure.
1. Heapify - process of creating a heap from a given array
2. Insertion - process of inserting an element in a heap [Time complexity :-  O(logn)]
3. Deletion - O(logn)
	Deleting the top element of the heap or the highest priority element, and then organizing the heap and returning the element with time complexity O(log N).

Generally, Heaps can be of two types:

Max-Heap: In a Max-Heap the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.
Min-Heap: In a Min-Heap the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it’s children. The same property must be recursively true for all sub-trees in that Binary Tree.

Advantages of Heap Data Structure:

Less time complexity, for inserting or deleting an element in the heap the time complexity is just O(log N).
It helps to find the minimum number and greatest number.
To just peek at the most prior element the time complexity is constant O(1).

Disadvantages of Heap Data Structure:

The time complexity for searching an element in Heap is O(N).
