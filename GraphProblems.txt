Question :- find minimum distance from source to destination graph?
Question :- Detect cycle in an undirected graph
			    Given an undirected graph with V vertices and E edges, check whether it contains any cycle or not.


Detect cycle in a directed graph
	Given a Directed Graph with V vertices (Numbered from 0 to V-1) and E edges, check whether it contains any cycle or not.

Topological Sorting
	Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge u v, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.

What is a Disjoint set data structure?
	Two sets are called disjoint sets if they don’t have any element in common, the intersection of sets is a null set.

A data structure that stores non overlapping or disjoint subset of elements is called disjoint set data structure. The disjoint set data structure supports following operations:
	Adding new sets to the disjoint set.
	Merging disjoint sets to a single disjoint set using Union operation.
	Finding representative of a disjoint set using Find operation.
	Check if two sets are disjoint or not. 


Disjoin set :- Used in Kruskal's algorithm.

	int P[] = new int[n]; 
	initalize(){
		for(int i=0; i<n ; i++){
			P[i] = i;
		}
	} 
	
	int find(int x){
		if(P[x] == x){
			return x;
		}
		return find(P[x]); 
	}
	
	void union(int a, int b){
		int x = find(a);
		int y= find(b);
		if(x==y)
			return;
		P[y] = x;
	}

Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm
	Given a graph and a source vertex in the graph, find the shortest paths from the source to all vertices in the given graph.
